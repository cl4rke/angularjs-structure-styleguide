angularjs-structure-styleguide
==============================

Basic, personal, opinionated style on structuring your AngularJS, adhering to [John Papa](https://github.com/johnpapa)'s [LIFT principle](https://github.com/johnpapa/angularjs-styleguide#application-structure-lift-principle).

**What is LIFT?**

- ```L```ocating our code is easy
- ```I```dentify code at a glance
- ```F```lat structure as long as we can
- ```T```ry to stay DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) or T-DRY

## 1. Context

This was created to offer a *more* in-depth guide for AngularJS developers that want their apps to scale, maintainable, and whatever

**This guide gives emphasis to components or directives** inspired by [ReactJS](facebook.github.io/react/) and [Flux](facebook.github.io/flux/). For more information in regards to this emphasis, check this [article](https://medium.com/@srph/breaking-down-angularjs-to-smaller-components-f2ab70a104d0) I wrote on Medium.

## 2. Overview

Basically, this is how our app will be.

### First-level simplification

```
├── app/
├── components/
├── core/
├── dist/
├── less|sass/
├── vendor/
```

### Extended

```
├── app/
|  ├── user
|  |  ├── partials/
|  |  ├── components/
|  |  |  ├── ThatDirective/
|  |  |  |  ├── i18n/
|  |  |  |  ├── tests/
|  ├── user.create/
|  ├── user.edit/
|  ├── newsCategory/
|  ├── newsCategory.create/

## 3. App

The ```app``` folder contains all the app's states. And each state may contain the controllers, directives, services to be **specifically** used for itself or child states.

```
├── app/
|  ├── user/
|  |  ├── i18n/
|  |  |  ├── en.js
|  |  |  ├── kr.js
|  |  ├── components/
|  |  ├── tests/
|  |  ├── partials/
|  |  ├── user.state.js
|  |  ├── user.controller.js
|  |  ├── user.html
├── ...
```

### Q: What is a state? ###

Used to register a state, see [ui-router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router). This also has been asked before, see [this issue](https://github.com/srph/angularjs-structure-styleguide/issues/1).

### Q: What if I started having more than 1 partial, controllers, and other things?

**Stop using multiple controllers, partials, services**. It is more **recommended** to use directives for the sake of modularity and maintainability. It is only okay to use partials for chunk of non-functioning mark-up.

```
├── app/
|  ├── user-profile/
|  |  ├── components/
|  |  |  ├── Avatar/
|  |  |  |  ├── Uploader.js
|  |  |  |  ├── Webcam/
|  |  |  |  |   ├── Webcam.js
|  |  |  |  |   ├── WebcamShootButton.js/
|  |  ├── user.state.js
|  |  ├── user.controller.js
|  |  ├── user.html
├── ...
```

### Q: What if I have nested states?

**As much as possible, try to avoid nested *directories* of states. For example, we have this state hierarchy:**

```
- main
  - user
    - user.create
    - user.edit
    - user.delete
    - profile
      - profile.create
      - profile.edit
      - profile.delete
```

This is how we structure our directory. Why? This way, nested states can be easily found and understood while adhering to the **LIFT** principle.

```
├── app/
|  ├── news/
|  ├── news.create/
|  ├── news-category/
|  ├── news-category.edit/
```

### Q: How do I indicate a url nest or a state nest?

**Use ```.```(dot) for states of the same module**. For instance, if we have the ```users``` *CRUD* module, then we'd have ```users.create```, ```users.edit```, **...**).

**Otherwise, use ```-``` to signify hierarchy**. For instance, we have a ```group``` module which is under the ```users``` module, then we'd have: (```users```, ```users.create```, **...**, ```users-groups```, ```users-groups.create```, **..**).

To elaborate, here's an example: an app consists of a news CRUD [url: ```/news/*```] and a news category CRUD [url: ```/news/categories/*```]. We expect it to have these states:

```
news (abstract state)
news.index
news.create
news.edit

news-category (abstract state)
news-category.index
news-category.create
news-category.edit
```

This is how we create our directory:

```
├── app/
|  ├── news/
|  ├── news.index/
|  ├── news.create/
|  ├── news.edit/
|  ├── news.category/
|  ├── news-category.index/
|  ├── news-category.create/
|  ├── news-category.edit/
```

### Q: What if my state is composed of two words?

**Use ``camelCase``; do not separate it with a ```-```(dash).** Do not use ```-```(dash) to signify that a name consists of two words. Use it to signify a nest or hierarchy. If a state consists of two separate words (e.g, soulja boy, sticky nav), use ```camelCase```. For example, ```souljaBoy```, ```stickyNav```.**.

Why? This allows us to properly signify and understand what a dot (```.```) and dash (```-```) does.

```
├── user/
├── user-awesomeName/
├── user-anotherModule/
├── user-maybeAnotherModule/
├── user-thatModule/
├── user-thatModule.index/
├── user-thatModule.create/
```

### Q: Where do I put my tests or i18n?

**Tests and i18n should be put close to our components or state as possible.**

*Why?* This avoids the replication of our structure for our tests; and, makes them easier to view.

### Q: How do I handle each language for the i18n?

**The filename of each i18n should signify only the language it is supposed to handle**. If a component only has one i18n file, simply put it at the same directory it will be used with.

```
|  ├── user
|  |  ├── en.js
|  |  ├── user.controller.js
|  |  ├── user.state.js
|  |  ├── ...
```

## 4. Core

The ```core``` folder contains all ```modules```, app ```bootstrapper``` (see [```angular.bootstrap```](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/function/angular.bootstrap)), and all *common* or *shared* files (in short, non-specific components) used in the app such as ```services```, ```constants```, ```controllers```, ```resources```, ```utils```, and ```filters```.

```
├── core/
|  ├── constants/
|  ├── filters/
|  ├── resources/
|  ├── services/
|  ├── utils/
|  |   ├── progress.config.js/
|  |   ├── restangular.config.js/
|  ├── app.js
|  ├── bootstrap.js
|  ├── constants.module.js
|  ├── components.module.js
|  ├── filters.module.js
|  ├── resources.module.js
|  ├── services.module.js
```

### Q: What does each of the js file in the *root* of the ```core``` folder do?

- ```app.js``` is our application module, the highest-level module, which contains all other modules. For instance, ```angular.module('app', ['app.resources', 'app.directives', 'app.services', 'app.constants']); ```.
- ```bootstrap.js``` does nothing but bootstrap the app ```angular.bootstrap(document, ['app'])```.
- ```*.module.js``` is the module to be respectively used for each (all *constants* in the ```constants/``` directory should use ```constant.module.js```).

### Q: What are ```resources```?
These come in handy when you frequently request an API for data. Fill in ```resources``` with your $http-service-wrappers to wrap ```$http``` or ```Restangular``` methods, or store data from a server response. Otherwise, put in the ```service``` as a normal service.

## 5. Components

The ```components``` folder contains mostly general-solution|non-feature-specific ```directives```.

```
├── components/
|  ├──  StickyNavThatDoesThat/
|  |  ├── tests/
|  |  ├── StickyNavThatDoesThat.spec.js
|  |  |  ├── Hamburger.spec.js
|  |  |  ├── Search.spec.js
|  |  ├── i18n/
|  |  |  ├── en.js
|  |  |  ├── jp.js
|  |  |  ├── kr.js
|  |  ├── tests/
|  |  ├── StickyNavThatDoesThat.js
|  |  ├── Hamburger.js
|  |  ├── Search.js
|  ├── AwesomeProgressBar/
|  |  ├── i18n/
|  |  ├── tests/
|  |  ├── AwesomeProgressBar.js
|  ├── components.module.js
```

### Q: Why is this named as ```components``` not ```directives```?

It took me a long while to decide whether how it should be named. After some time, I preferred to use ```components``` *because* our ```directives``` are actually being used as components. Again, your preference.

### Q: Why are the directives separated from other angular modules?

I had decided to separate directives because:

1. Directives are way too large to be nested inside the ```core``` folder.
2. They need emphasis and will contain mostly a large part of your app

**Write the file names of your directives (components) in StudlyCase**.

*Why? To emphasize components.* In the future, I might tweak a huge part of the guide to *StudyCase*. *camelCase* does not seem to give proper emphasis to itself, so.

## 6. Overall

Do not forget that this is a personal, opinionated structure styleguide. Although I have been using an almost-similar structure in production, your structure will vary on your project (team size, etc) from time-to-time. Make sure to keep it simple.

It is *always* better to create feature-based instead of role-based structure. Because, based on my experience, role-based structure will always be harder to write, read, and maintain.

Like I said in the [Context](#1-context), please feel free to diverge.
